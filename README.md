---

## 📦 Installation
To install the project dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can use the indicated commands to start development or the server:
### 📜 Scripts

### 1. Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Description: Starts the Next.js development server.

What it does:

Builds the application in development mode.
Starts a local server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing changes to be reflected immediately in the browser.

### 2. JSON Server:
```bash
npm run start-server
```
Description: Starts a Node.js server that runs the src/server.js file.

Why use it: This command is used to run the JSON Server, allowing you to simulate a RESTful API during development.

Benefits:

Test application functionalities without a real backend.
Provide simulated data quickly and efficiently. The server.js file is configured to initialize the JSON Server, allowing your Next.js application to interact with it as if it were a real API.
