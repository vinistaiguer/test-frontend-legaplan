---

## 📦 Installation
To install the project dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can use the indicated commands to start development or the server:
### 📜 Scripts

### 1. Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
#### Description:

Starts the Next.js development server.

#### What it does:

Builds the application in development mode.
Starts a local server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing changes to be reflected immediately in the browser.

### 2. FIRESTORE:
I am using Firestore to persist data.

#### Description:

Firestore is an excellent choice for persisting real-time data, especially in applications that require scalability and efficient synchronization between devices.

#### Why use it:

In the model I am sharing, it is a basic example of how to persist data in Firestore, whether to add, update, delete, or query documents.

#### Benefits:

Test application functionalities without a real backend.
Provide simulated data quickly and efficiently. The server.js file is configured to initialize the JSON Server, allowing your Next.js application to interact with it as if it were a real API.
